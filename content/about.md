# About Me
Greetings! I'm Tanmay Fuse, a seasoned DevOps Engineer with over 3.9 years of hands-on experience in streamlining development and operations processes. Currently, I'm contributing my skills and expertise to Varian Medical Systems, where I play a pivotal role in managing critical aspects of our infrastructure.

# Educational Journey
I embarked on my professional journey after graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Prof Ram Meghe Institute of Research and Technology. To further enhance my technical prowess, I pursued additional training at CDAC, broadening my skill set and preparing me for the dynamic landscape of DevOps.

# Professional Expertise
In my current role, I take charge of the Grafana instance, overseeing its seamless operation. Additionally, I am responsible for the Availability Application, a vital tool for monitoring application availability and response times. My role extends to onboarding Dynatrace for monitoring Kubernetes workloads and Azure resources, demonstrating my proficiency in cutting-edge technologies.

# Technical Proficiency
I bring to the table a robust knowledge base encompassing KQL query language, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, ARM templates, Azure DevOps, CI/CD, and monitoring solutions. My commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements is evident in my ongoing journey to master Golang and the Cobra CLI Golang library. This endeavor is aimed at developing a project that streamlines application configuration management and facilitates seamless deployments across diverse environments.

# Project Highlights
One of my notable achievements includes crafting Terraform configurations for managing Azure Log Analytics alerts, showcasing my ability to tackle complex infrastructure challenges. I've successfully deployed Dynatrace operators on Kubernetes clusters, enabling the efficient monitoring of workloads. For monitoring Azure resources, I meticulously constructed Terraform configurations, incorporating Azure Functions and Event Hubs. To further enhance monitoring capabilities, I deployed the Dynatrace Azure Log Application, seamlessly funneling metrics from Azure resources to Dynatrace.

# Future Aspirations
Looking ahead, I'm gearing up to onboard Dynatrace Monaco, a step towards automating and optimizing Dynatrace processes. This aligns with my ongoing commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of DevOps.

# Personal Growth
Beyond the technical realm, I'm actively engaged in personal growth. Learning Golang and the Cobra CLI Golang library for my project is not just a professional pursuit but a personal passion to contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Join me on this exciting journey as I navigate the intricate world of DevOps, share insights, and explore the limitless possibilities of technology. Welcome to my blog.
